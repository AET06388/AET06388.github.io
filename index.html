		<h2>What is a circuit?</h2>
		<p>A electrical circuit is a closed loop in which current flows. The average electronic device
		(phone, computer, lightbulb, et cetera) draws power to function and would be useless otherwise.
		Two main types of circuits exist: DC (Direct Current) and AC (Alternating Current).</p>
		<ul>Direct current circuits have current only flowing in a single direction at any moment
		in time. Current flows from the positive end of a resistor to the negative end (for those of you
		familar with physics, this is the <i>opposite</i> of electron flow).</ul>
		<ul>Alternating current may flow in either direction at a given point. The direction of current
		in any particular moment is determined by the frequency of the voltage source.</ul>

		<h2>What does a circuit look like?</h2>

		<p><div style="font-size:8pt">Picture provided courtesy of wikipedia's creative commons license</div>
		Pictured above is a simple DC circuit containing a voltage source and a resistor. Current flows in the direction
		of the arrow labeled <i>i</i>. The voltage produced by the source <i>v</i> is delivered to the resistor <i>R</i>.
		This process repeats until the voltage source is unable to produce additional power. Alternating current voltage sources
		look similar to the DC source pictured, but their voltage <i>v</i> is represented by a periodic function of time that could be
		positive or negative at any given time. Typically the voltage of an AC voltage source is represented by a sine function. </p>
